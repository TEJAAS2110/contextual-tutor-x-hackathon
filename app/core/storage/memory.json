In this paper, we conducted a semantic \ncontent analysis on 10,161 CC job postings using semi-automated text-mining and probabilistic \ntopic-modeling procedures to discover the competency areas and skill sets as semantic topics. Our \nfindings revealed 22 competency areas and 46 skills, which reflect the interdisciplinary background \nof CC jobs. The top five competency areas for CC were identified as “Engineering,” “Development,” \n“Security,” “Architecture,” and “Management.” Besides, the top three skills emerged as “Commu-\nnication Skills,” “DevOps Tools,” and “Software Development.” Considering the findings, a com-\npetency-skill map was created that illustrates the correlations between CC competency areas and \ntheir related skills. Although there are many studies on CC, the competency areas and skill sets \nrequired to deal with cloud computing have not yet been empirically studied. Our findings can \ncontribute to CC candidates and professionals, IT organizations, and academic institutions in un-\nderstanding, evaluating, and developing the competencies and skills needed in the CC industry. \nKeywords: cloud computing; skill requirements; competency areas; topic modeling; job-posting \nanalysis; text mining \n \n1. Introduction \nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have accelerated the \ntransition of many companies, institutions, and governments to cloud computing (CC) \nbecause cloud services and applications provide the flexibility and scalability that can \nhelp them to manage such crises more effectively. With the emergence of the COVID-19 \npandemic, many companies and institutions have embraced teleworking more than be-\nfore, leveraging CC-based services and applications to reduce the risk of virus transmis-\nsion and manage the current crisis [1]. In this pandemic era that restricts working and \nsocial-life conditions, CC has become one of the most prominent information technologies \nthanks to the solutions and modernizations it provides in the delivery of computing re-\nsources and services [2,3]. Therefore, cloud computing (CC), which is envisaged as the \nleading paradigm of resource and service delivery, is also considered the next generation \nof computing [4–6]. CC offers significant flexibility in pricing computing services by al-\nlowing organizations to only pay for the resources and services they use [7,8]. Therefore, \nCC, which is accepted as next-generation computing, has become the main paradigm of \nresource and service delivery [4–6]. In addition, CC provides many innovations such as \nCitation: Ozyurt, O.; Gurcan, F.; \nDalveren, G.G.M.; Derawi, M.  \nCareer in Cloud Computing:  \nExploratory Analysis of In-Demand \nCompetency Areas and Skill Sets. \nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 9787. \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/app12199787 \nAcademic Editors: Pentti Nieminen \nReceived: 18 August 2022  \nAccepted: 27 September 2022 \nPublished: 28 September 2022 \nPublisher’s Note: MDPI stays neu-\ntral with regard to jurisdictional \nclaims in published maps and institu-\ntional affiliations. \n \nCopyright: © 2022 by the authors. \nLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. \nThis article is an open access article \ndistributed under the terms and \nconditions of the Creative Commons \nAttribution \n(CC \nBY) \nlicense \n(https://creativecommons.org/license\ns/by/4.0/).\n\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 9787 \n2 of 15 \n \nadvanced institutional visibility, easier collaboration, rapid development, consistency \nacross platforms, enhanced security, lower risk, and reduced cost [5,6,9]. Thanks to these \ninnovations, CC is accepted as the fifth service after four basic services, including water, \nelectricity, gas, and telephone [6,10]. \nIn line with these modernizations, the adoption of CC technologies has been increas-\ning rapidly in recent years [6,11]. It is estimated that end-user spending on public cloud \nservices globally will increase by 23.1%, from USD 332.3 billion in 2021 to USD 397.5 bil-\nlion in 2022 [12]. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a major impact on this growth, \nand the demand for critical CC resources and services has increased exponentially during \nthe pandemic [13]. In another view, cloud platforms and ecosystems will serve as a \nlaunching pad for a future explosion of digital innovation in the next five years [6]. In this \ncontext, the CC industry will become even more important for IT professionals in the near \nfuture [14]. These dizzying developments in the CC industry will further increase the de-\nmand for a skilled workforce [15]. The CC industry has a dynamic and entrepreneurial \nworking environment in which capable human resources are used effectively [9]. There-\nfore, today’s CC job market offers significant employment and career opportunities for IT \nprofessionals [9]. One of the dynamic information sources about competencies, \nknowledge, and skills demanded by the CC job market is online employment platforms \n[15,16]. These platforms are also important communication tools between employees and \nemployers. A large number of CC job postings are posted on these platforms every day. \nThese job postings can be considered an important indicator that reveals emerging needs \nand trends in today’s CC job market [17–19]. \nIn this respect, job postings, which is used for employment in this field, can be seen \nas an indicator of CC industry needs and trends [15,16]. Therefore, analysis of job postings \nis important not only to identify the competencies demanded for the workforce, but also \nto identify current trends in the CC industry [16]. With regard to the analysis of job post-\nings, numerous studies have been conducted on different sub-contexts of IT jobs using \nvarious text-mining techniques [3,19,20]. In analyzing job postings, these studies mostly \naimed to reveal the competencies and skills required for subfields of IT such as computer \nscience, big data, software engineering, computer programming, and big-data software \nengineering [15–17,21–23]. On the other hand, it is possible to mention a few articles on \nthe identification of CC competencies and the inclusion of these competencies in the cur-\nricula of IT departments, such as computer science and software engineering [8,15,24–26]. \nThese studies have highlighted the gap in the skilled workforce needed in the CC industry \nin general. In this regard, these valuable studies and efforts to reveal and meet the com-\npetent-workforce gap in the CC industry constitute the motivation and background of our \nstudy. Although many studies have been conducted on CC in different contexts, the com-\npetencies and skill sets required for cloud computing have not yet been empirically stud-\nied. \nConsidering this background, this study aimed to identify the knowledge domains, \nskill sets, and competencies demanded by the CC industry. In this regard, a semantic con-\ntent analysis was performed on CC job postings using text-mining procedures and a prob-\nabilistic topic-modeling approach based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). As a result, \nthis analysis revealed the 22 main competency areas and 46 trending topics (skills) essen-\ntial for CC jobs. Afterwards, a competency taxonomy for CC was developed by calculating \nthe distribution of discovered topics (skills) according to competency areas. From this \npoint of view, it is expected that identifying and understanding the up-to-date knowledge \ndomains and skill sets demanded by the CC industry will offer valuable contributions to \nmeet the need for a qualified workforce in this field. \n2. Materials and Methods \nConsistent with the purpose of the study, the research methodology was designed \nbased on topic-modeling processes that reveal the main dynamics, themes, and trends of \nCC’s vibrant job market as topics discovered with quantitative procedures.
